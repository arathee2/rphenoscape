#' Retrieve phenotypes by entity, quality, taxon, and study
#'
#' Retrieves "semantic phenotypes", i.e., phenotypes encodes as ontological
#' expressions. Filtering is possible by anatomical entity (optionally including
#' entities related by certain properties, see `includeRels`), phenotypic
#' quality, taxonomic group where the phenotypes have been recorded, and study
#' (a.k.a. publication).
#'
#' Entity, quality, and taxon can be given as IRI or as name (i.e, term label).
#' In the latter case, names will be resolved to IRIs against anatomy ontologies,
#' PATO, and taxonomy ontologies, respectively. Warnings will be issued if only
#' a partial match can be found. The study must be given as IRI.
#' @param entity character, the anatomical entity by which to filter, if any.
#' @param quality character, the phenotypic quality by which to filter, if any.
#' @param taxon character, the taxon by which to filter, if any.
#' @param study character, the identifier of the study by which to filter, if any.
#' @param includeRels character or vector of characters. The names of relationships
#'   for anatomical entities to include in addition to subtype (`rdfs:subClassOf`).
#'   Defaults to `"part of"`. Set to `FALSE` to not include any additional relationships.
#'   Otherwise one or more of `"part of"`, `"historical homologous to"`, and
#'   `"serially homologous to"`, or set to `TRUE` to include all possible ones. It
#'   is acceptable to use unambiguous prefixes, for example `"historical"`.
#' @param .withTaxon logical, whether to include taxa in the result if `taxon` is
#'   provided. If TRUE, only the combination of phenotype and taxon will be
#'   unique in the returned data frame. Default is FALSE, meaning by default
#'   providing a value for `taxon` only acts as another filter but does not
#'   change format or redundancy of the result. Ignored if `taxon` is
#'   not provided as a character value.
#' @param verbose logical, whether to print messages informing about potentially
#'   time-consuming operations. Default is FALSE.

#'                           .withTaxon = TRUE)
#' head(phens2a)
#' nrow(phens2a) - nrow(phens2) # lots of redundancy due to n:n relationship
#' nrow(unique(phens2a[,c("id", "label")])) == nrow(phens2) # but some #phenotypes
#'
#' # can compute and visualize similarity
#' sm <- jaccard_similarity(terms = phens2$id, .labels = phens2$label, .colnames = "label")
#' plot(hclust(as.dist(1-sm)))
#' }
#' @return A data frame with columns "id" and "label".
#'
#'   If a character value for `taxon` was provided, and `.withTaxon` is TRUEâ€™,
#'   columns "taxon.id" and "taxon.label" will be returned as well. While
#'   (phenotypes, taxon) tuples will be unique, both phenotypes and taxa
#'   individually will then be redundant in the returned data frame (the
#'   association is n:n).

\usage{
pk_is_extinct(taxon, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{taxon}{character, the taxa or list of taxa, as names or IRIs. Names
will first be looked up, and a warning will be issued for names that fail
to be found as a taxon name. Names and IRIs can be intermixed.}

\item{verbose}{logical, whether or not to print informative messages for
possibly time-consuming operations. The default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A logical named vector with value \code{TRUE} if the corresponding input
taxon is marked as extinct, and FALSE otherwise. For taxon names that failed
to be looked up, the value will be NA. Names will be the input taxa where
there were given as names, and the label of the respective taxon otherwise.
}

This is simply a convenience function on top of \code{\link[=pk_taxon_detail]{pk_taxon_detail()}}.
